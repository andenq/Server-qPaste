Contributions

You acknowledge that by contributing to this service/product (qPaste Server) your code may end up being used in a commercial, pay to use product.
That being said, the only reason for the acknowledgment above is in case that donations are not enough, and we have to start offering a payed version of the service to keep it running.
By "paid version of the service" we mean an alternative to the free version, a version we will always try offer as much as possible (so pleeaase donate)!
The code will however stay open source and free for non-commercial use, even in the case of a payed version showing up. That is our agreement to you.
